### Role and Actions

As one of the Back-End Developer, I was responsible for:

- Designed and managed the relational database schema.
- Implemented OTP functionality and account management features.
- Oversaw project repository and enforced version control standards.

### Development Process

I began by designing the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database, leveraging my confidence in database design and my understanding of ERD concepts from our lectures. This task was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge to a real-world dataset and ensure the system could handle large volumes of data effectively.

Another key responsibility I handled was implementing the account management system. I started with the core functionalities—login, signup, and password reset—and ensured they worked reliably before integrating the OTP (One-Time Password) feature. This structured approach helped maintain stability and allowed for seamless addition of the OTP verification process.

As the repository manager, I ensured all changes went through a pull request process, allowing me to review and test every update before merging it into the main branch. I also enforced proper commit message conventions to maintain clarity and consistency across the project's version history, making it easier for all team members to understand the development progress.

### Challenges and Solution

The main challenge I encountered was related to data manipulation. Due to the database’s complexity and size, some developers questioned why certain data wasn't placed in separate tables. As the person who designed the schema, I took the time to clearly explain the reasoning behind the structure and guided them in retrieving the necessary data effectively. This collaborative approach helped maintain the integrity of the database design while supporting the team's development needs.

### Final Take

This project helped me improve both my programming and teamwork skills. I designed the database, built the account system with OTP, and managed the project repository. I made sure each feature worked step by step and kept the code organized using pull requests and clear commit messages. One challenge was explaining the database design to teammates, but I guided them through it. Overall, I learned how to handle technical tasks, work with others, and solve problems effectively.
